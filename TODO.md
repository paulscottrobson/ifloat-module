# TODO List

- Wrapper for functions. 
    - Reset stack and string stuff
    - test with sample, converting the caller.

- Pass in values : move to Y, test those functions.
- Write a better test suite using it, though polynomials are pretty good in of themselves
- Remove all the PHA/PHX/PHY pairs & check it still works. Add carry clear for all operations.
- Overall Float A/B , aFlags usage especially overwriting. 
- Documentation

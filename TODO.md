# TODO List

- Write a better test suite using it, though polynomials are pretty good in of themselves
    - Write initial code for strtoint strtofloat
    - Write initial code for inttostr floattostr
    
- Remove all the PHA/PHX/PHY pairs & check it still works. 
- Overall Float A/B , aFlags usage especially overwriting. 
- Documentation
- Implement comparison which I forgot about (check Foenix BASIC ?)

# TODO List

## Conversion group
- StrToInt          [needs converting for 65816 via macros ld [],y]
- StrToFloat         [needs converting for 65816 via macros ld [],y]

## Polynomial group
- Polynomial code 
- Test depth of push pop, Rig up better.

## Then
- Rename stuff.
- Tidy up.
- Outer call (needs to zero internal stack and the string size and data)
- Make one file, rewrite builder.py
- Write a better test suite, though polynomials are pretty good.
